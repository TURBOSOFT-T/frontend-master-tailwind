# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

There are many ways to do CSS with React. Even just in this course I've done several ways with style-components and emotion. Both of those are fantastic pieces of software and could definitely still be used today. As is the case when I teach this course I try to cover the latest material and what I think is the current state-of-the-art of the industry and today I think that is TailwindCSS.

Both style-components and emotion are libraries that execute in the JavaScript layer. They bring your CSS into your JavaScript. This allows you all the power of JavaScript to manipulate styles using JavaScript.

Tailwind however is a different approach to this. And it bears mentioning that Tailwind isn't tied to React at all (whereas styled-components is and emotion mostly is.) Everything I'm showing you here is just incidentally using React (though Tailwind is particularly popular amongst React devs.)

Let's get it set up. Run this:

npm i -D tailwindcss@3.1.8 postcss@8.4.18 autoprefixer@10.4.12
Under the hood, Vite processes all your CSS with PostCSS with the autoprefixer plugin. This works like Babel: it means you can write modern code and it'll make it backwards compatible with older browsers. Since we're modifying the PostCSS config (like we did with Babel earlier in this project in the Intro part) we have to give it the whole config now.
Okay, now let's get our Tailwind project going.

npx tailwindcss init -p
